                    ; Good morning!
                    ; On this page you will find a compilation of links useful for Japanese language learning and short & brief description of each.

                    ;.[lml] Tofugu's website contains hundreds of articles on Japanese language & culture. Their [grammar](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/) articles specifically are really good and highly reccomended.

                    ;###.[center-text] [Learn the Kana by Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/)
                    ;.[lml] Tofugu's PDFs (or webpages) are one of the better ways to memorize your Kana for the first time; instead of learning them in weeks, you can learn them in hours (speaking from experience, it took me 8 hours total for both hiragana and katakana).
                    ; Their guides utilize mnemonics to help you drill them quickly into your head, but after reading enough these will dissapear until you can "just read". If you want to go straight to the content (PDF downloads) then use these links:

                        ;- [ひらがな](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana-book-pdf/).[normal]
                        ;- [カタカナ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana-book-pdf/).[normal]

                    ;###.[center-text] [WaniKani by Tofugu](https://www.wanikani.com/)
                    ;.[lml] Wanikani by Tofugu (last Tofugu one I swear) is in my opinion the best way to learn Kanji. The website teaches you first some radicals (Kanji building blocks), then some Kanji and then incorporates said Kanji into vocabulary, and then add on top a SRS system to help you memorize everything with little effort.

                    <hr>
                    ;###.[center-text] [Torii SRS](https://torii-srs.com/)
                    ;.[lml] Although Wanikani does teach you some vocabulary, it probably won't be enough to read a whole book; that's where Torii comes in. Torii works the same as Wanikani (has a SRS system) but only teaches vocabulary, you can even select an option to remove Wanikani taught vocabulary!

                    <hr>
                    ;###.[center-text] [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
                    ;.[lml] Found vocabulary not on Wanikani nor Torii? Want to study grammar without shelling out money for [Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp/)? Make whatever flashcards you want and add them to a SRS system using Anki.

                    <hr>
                    ;###.[center-text] [Jisho](https://jisho.org)
                    ;.[lml] The best english-japanese (英和) dictionary out there. Can help you break down japanese sentences as well. Reccomend [this browser extension](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-learning-resources-database/jisho-pitcher/">this browser extension) to see pitch accent.

                    ;###.[center-text] [Tadoku free books](https://tadoku.org/japanese/free-books/)
                    ;.[lml] Good place to practise reading after you've learnt some vocabulary. Alternativley, use [Satori reader](https://www.satorireader.com/).
