The person knocking on the door is a murderer out for your brother. Would you lie and tell the murderer that your brother is not here? Then you violate the universal imperativ of lying.

                    ;### Environmental Ethics
                    ; Returning to the previously defined three views. Take this scenario: Humans in the amazonas need to cut down trees to make food for their children.<br>
                    ; According to the anthropocentric view, nature is in the service of humans, which defines this scenario as morally correct, the humans are allowed to cut down the forest to make food since humans are at the top of the pyramid. This answers help human flourish, even if the land will be unsuable after a short 3-4 years.<br>
                    ; Nobody else in nature takes care of humans, not the monkeys, not the babboons, not the whales, only us, we take care of ourselves.<br>
                    ; According to the biocentric view, everything has an intrinsic value. You can't just use animals and nature for your own sake. There are certain conditions where you say “stop, we've already done enough, we shouldn't do this”.<br>
                    ; We are not the only ones with our own intrests, why shouldn't animals have the right not to suffer? But how can we extend rights to animals, do they have a self, are they conciouss to the same extent as us. Can they demand and enforce their rights? can they express their rights?<br>
                    ; When do your rights start to apply? When are you conciouss? When do you become an agent yourself. When you are 5? When you are 3? When you are born?<br>
                    ; What do you base your ehtics on? The consequences? Your duty? Your character? The best is a combination of the three. <br>
                    ; According to the ecocentric view, the group matters. The ecosystem. The individual is there, but in a certain sense dissapears into the mass, into the ecological habitat. The individual isn't as paramount as the system. If a few lions die to protect the ecosystem, then so be it. As long as you save the upholding conditions for the group, then you have done something right.<br>
                    ; Suffering and pain is connected to the conciousness. If the goal is to lower and dimish the pain for all creatures, then the obvious solution becomes to lower the ammount of conciouss beings, because conciouss beings are the ones who suffer.<br>
                    ; But are you ready to kill of creatures soley for deminishing the ammount of suffering in the world.<br>
                    ; Many researches within environmental ethics agree that humans are the species that create the most suffering on the world. The less humans on the earth, the less suffering.<br>
                    ; s{But no one is consequent, they aren't starting with themsevles, they, and their family, are excluded. You and your family, gone, good, but me, I stay}.[t-orn].<br>
                    ; There by this reasoning is not appliable, which means it's not good ethical thinking. Good ethical thinking is appliable.<br>
                    ; Poverty is one of the main causes for pollution, they can't afford to be biocentric nor ecocentric. Their hands are forced to be anthropocentric. They have to survive, both them and their children.<br>
                    ; Some researchers believe that we are on the verge of the sixth giant extinction. There have been five before us, and they were natural. During the cambrian period there were a huge number of species, but now they are gone. <i>Species come, and species go</i>.  30,000 years we have lived for, nothing compared to the long history of evolution on earth. What decides that we are the successful ones, <i>Homo Sapiens are one of the 4 human species</i>.

                    ; <i>Should science fit societies needs? Or should society conform to science?</i>
                    ; In 585 BCE Thales correctly predicted the next solar eclipse; and it was not based on guessing, it was based on knowledge and method. s{Science is by definiton a sort of method, used to garner knowledge about the world}.[t-orn], the universe, the micro level, whatever level you want.<br><br>
                    ; s{Thales discovered that you should make observations, and by observations you discover patterns, patterns of behaviour. By means of finding patterns you can create predictions. Then you repeat, you make new observations, which will either confirm or falsify your prediction.}.[t-orn]<br><br>
                    ; In between the step of observations and predictions you are supposed to make an interventions as well, and then the patterns are a cause and affect of said intervention. s{From the discovered patterns you can make an inferance of the cause and effect}.[t-orn].

                    ; s{Some say that science is progressive}.[t-orn]. This means that knowledge increases to the better. Our state of knowledge now, 2024, is qualitivley better than the knowledge 1823. s{The knowledge is increasing, it's progressive. This is an objective fact}.[t-orn].

                    ; Albert is a chemist, he has a good reputation based on his work on protein synthesis. He is known for his theory that a certain types of genes are specific for protein synthesis within mamals. He has named this gene the “albert gene”. This fact has been observed several times. We have seen that it's role within this synthesis is essential, it's the “albert genere”.<br>
                    ; In another university not that far away there is another researcher, Johhny is in his 20s, and he has made a discvoery through better technology that it's not the “albert gene” that is essential for protein synthesis. He publishes this contradictary knowledge. The albert collaborators are ofcourse negative and deny it. s{Science is humanly subjective}. There is a certain ammount of subjective attitude to science. s{Science is a human endavour}.[t-orn].<br>

                    ;## A conclusion: The connection between ethics, science and environment
                    ; Environmental ethics explores the relationship between humans and nature from different perspectives: anthropocentric, biocentric, and ecocentric. These views influence how we perceive and address environmental issues. Ethics and morals guide our actions, and can be non-cognitive (emotion-driven) or cognitive (reason-based). Three systems of ethical judgement include utilitarianism, deontic ethics, and virtue ethics.<br>
                    ;  The Universal Moral Imperative and the Principle of Humanity are powerful ethical tools. Science plays a crucial role in understanding and addressing environmental issues, using methods like induction and deduction. However, science can be both objective and subjective, and its findings can sometimes contradict cultural norms or beliefs. <br>
                    ; s{Balancing ethics, science, and environmental needs is crucial}.[t-orn].
