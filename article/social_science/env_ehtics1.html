                                ;- - We are on of millions of species. But nature is not in the service of human needs, some other species might be more important for nature than humans, to keep nature running.

                        ;- Econentric view

                                ;- - It's hard to speak about species in isolation from environment. Species are living organisms, but ecosystems include non-living factors such as mountain, river, water, etc.
                                ;- - There's disctinction between relevant and important. Relevant means important in context.
                                ;- - Symbiosis, many species are interconnected, humans and bacteria, water and plants, etc.

                    ;### Nature and Humans
                    ; Humans consider themselves special because they are able to speak through spoken symbolic language. s{If we humans are different; then why should we care about natur, and how should we care? What is the best ethical attitude}.[t-org]?

                    ;**

                    ; s{Non-cognitive thinking does not give reason, it's about statements. These are driven by emotion}.[t-orn]. They are subjective and culturally relative; s{the group determines what is bad, and what is good}.[t-orn].

                    ---
                    ;### Cognitive (Trink, Reason, Argue)
                    ; s{True or false; we think, reason & argue. We have to argue and state a case for why we believe the statement is true or false}.[t-orn].

                            ;- My facts come form non-natural facts, these can be grounded in aesthetics, but these can be non-cognitive by the eye of the holder.

                    ;### "Ethics" and Systems
                    ;*[lml]
                        ;- Consequentialism = Effects
                        ;- One of the most famous examples of consequentialism is utilitarianism. s{Utilitarianism means “the biggest good for the most”}.[t-orn]. You should think s{“What will be the consequences of my action?”}.[t-orn] and s{“What will be the most positive for most?”}.[t-orn].
                        ;- Utilitarianists often speak of princples like utility (something akin to happiness).
                        ;- s{Utilitarianism is the reigning politic on the global level nowadays}.[t-orn]. 
                        ;- Utilitarianistic applies to both the now and the future, but the future is non-predictable.

                    ;### Deontic
                    ;*[lml]
                        ;- Deontic = Duty
                        ;- However, s{sometimes duties will conflict}.[t-orn]. Who sets the standard? Who decides that this is your duty? The answers to these questions are subjective and will vary from culture to culture. 
                    ;**

                    ---
                    ;### Virtue Ethics
                    ; What is the most appropriate way to act? s{In virtue ethics you embody what is right and wrong. You don’t follow the effects nor consequences, you don't follow your deontic duties, <i>you follow yourself & your character because you are you</i>}.[t-orn].
                    ; A wise man knows when to be merciful and when to be just.

                    ; In summary, we have three different ways to judge:
                    ;**[lml]
                        ;- Consequences → Utilitarianism
                        ;- Duty-based → Deontic ethics
                        ;- Virtue → Character
