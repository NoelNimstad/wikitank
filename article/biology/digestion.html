                <p>The definition of digestion is “The biological process of breaking down food (a composition of macromolecules*)”; digestion is the process by which larger insoluble substances are broken down into small water-soluble substances that can be absorbed into the blood plasma.</p>
                <p class="note">* Macromolecules are molecules made up of smaller organic molecules. The four classes of macromolecules are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids.</p>
                <h2>What is the digestive system?</h2>
                <p>The digestive system is mainly made of your gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) but also consists of the liver, pancreas and gallbladder. The GI tract stretches across multiple different and hollow organs from mouth to anus, each with its respective functions.</p>
                <p>The hollow organs which make up the GI tract are:</p>
                <ul class="n lml">
                    <li>The mouth</li>
                    <li>Esophagus</li>
                    <li>Stomach</li>
                    <li>Small intestine</li>
                    <li>Large intestine</li>
                    <li>Anus</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The solid organs are, as previously mentioned, the liver, pancreas & gallbladder.</p>
                <p>Many of the follow organs themselves consist of different parts. The small intestine has three: the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. As for the large intestine, it consists of the appendix (vestigial structure), cecum (the first part), colon (the “main” part) and rectum.</p>
                <p>Other parts of your body that contribute to digestion include the bacteria in your GI tract (also referred to as “gut flora” or microbiome) and parts of your nervous & circulatory system. Working together, your nerves, hormones, bacteria, blood and digestive system organs digest the foods and liquids which you consume.</p>

                <h3 class="sub">Mouth</h3>
                 <p>The mouth contributes to digestion through its teeth, which mechanically break down food into small pieces, and its tongue, which mixes food with saliva (contains amylase, enzyme that breaks down starch). Moreover, the epiglottis is a flap-like structure at the back of the throat whose purpose is to preventing food and liquids to enter the trachea (respiratory tract). The epiglottis is located in the Pharynx.</p>

                </div>
                <h3 class="sub">Esophagus</h3>
                <p>The esophagus secretes mucus and moves food from the throat to the stomach using muscle movement called peristalsis. The esophagus is approximately 20cm long.<br/><br/>If stomach acid ends up in the esophagus then it results in hurtburn, a burning sensation in your chest (heart-area).</p>

                </div>
                <h3 class="sub">Stomach</h3>
                <p>The stomach is J-shaped muscular which stores food you eat and breaks it down into smaller, more handleable pieces. It mixes food with digestive juices that contain enzymes which break down proteins (protease) and lipids (lipase). Stomach acid (HCl) kills dangerous bacterias and it's pH is typically anywhere between 1.5 - 2. Food in the stomach and bellow is reffered to as chyme.</p>

                <h3 class="sub">Small Intestine</h3>
                <p>The small intestine is roughly 7m long and is lined with finger-like projections called villi who purpose is to increase the surface area of the small intestine (for the purpose of absorption). Additionaly, the villi themselves are covered in microvilli which further increases surface area. In total, the small intestine boasts a surface area of roughly 250m<sup>2</sup> (almost equivalent to the area of a tennis court). The small intestine absorbs nutrients into the bloodstream from food through their walls.</p> 
                <p>The small intestine secretes three different types of digestive enzymes: protease (proteins), amylase (starches) & lipase (lipids).</p>
                <p>From the small intenstine, the following is absorbed:</p>
                <ul class="n lml">
                    <li>80% of ingested water</li>
                    <li>Vitamins</li>
                    <li>Minerals</li>
                    <li>Carbohydrates</li>
                    <li>Proteins</li>
                    <li>Lipids</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="sub">Large Intestine</h3>       
                <p>The large intestine serves 3 main functions: absorbing water (of the 20% not absorbed by the small intestines) and electrolytes, producing and absorbing vitamins, as well as forming and moving stool to the rectum for elimination of waste.</p>
                <p>More than 500 different species of bacteria live within the large intestine. With the help of these, bacterial fermentation of indigestible materials takes place. The large intestine typically contains 1 - 2kg of bacteria which produce various types of vitamins, but mainly vitamin K.</p>

                <h3 class="sub">Rectum</h3>
                <p>The rectum is the lower part of the large intestine that connects to the sigmoid colon. It is about 15 cm long. It receives waste from the colon and stores it until it passes out of the body through the anus.</p>

                </div>
                <h3 class="sub">Liver</h3>
                <p>Liver is the largest solid organ in the body. Liver directly affects digestion by producing bile (that helps digest fat) and filters out toxins and waste including drugs, alcohol and poisons.</p>

                <h3 class="sub">Enzymes</h3>
                <p>An enzyme is a biological catalyst and is almost always a protein. It speeds up the rate of a specific chemical reaction in the cell.</p>
                
                <p>The enzyme is not destroyed during the reaction and is used over and over.</p>
