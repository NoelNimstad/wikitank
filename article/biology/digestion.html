                <p>The definition of digestion is “The biological process of breaking down food (a composition of macromolecules*)”; digestion is the process by which larger insoluble substances are broken down into small water-soluble substances that can be absorbed into the blood plasma.</p>
                <p class="note">* Macromolecules are molecules made up of smaller organic molecules. The four classes of macromolecules are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids.</p>
                <h2>What is the digestive system?</h2>
                <p>The digestive system is mainly made of your gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) but also consists of the liver, pancreas and gallbladder. The GI tract stretches across multiple different and hollow organs from mouth to anus, each with its respective functions.</p>
                <p>The hollow organs which make up the GI tract are:</p>
                <ul class="n lml">
                    <li>The mouth</li>
                    <li>Esophagus</li>
                    <li>Stomach</li>
                    <li>Small intestine</li>
                    <li>Large intestine</li>
                    <li>Anus</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The solid organs are, as previously mentioned, the liver, pancreas & gallbladder.</p>
                <p>Many of the follow organs themselves consist of different parts. The small intestine has three: the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. As for the large intestine, it consists of the appendix (vestigial structure), cecum (the first part), colon (the “main” part) and rectum.</p>
                <p>Other parts of your body that contribute to digestion include the bacteria in your GI tract (also referred to as “gut flora” or microbiome) and parts of your nervous & circulatory system. Working together, your nerves, hormones, bacteria, blood and digestive system organs digest the foods and liquids which you consume.</p>

                    <h4>Mouth</h4>
                </div>
                 <p>Teeth mechanically break down food into small pieces. Tongue mixes food with saliva (contains amylase, which helps break down starch). Epiglottis is a flap-like structure at the back of the throat that closes over the trachea preventing food from entering it. It is located in the Pharynx.</p>

                    <h4>Esophagus</h4>
                </div>
                <p> Esophagus moves food from the throat to the stomach using muscle movement called peristalsis. It has secrete mucus. Esophagus is approximately 20 cm long. If acid form stomach is going up to esophagus - it's called hurtburn, because you feel burning in chest (heart-area).</p>

                    <h4>Stomach</h4>
                </div>
                <p>Stomach is J-shaped muscular bag that stores the food you eat, breaks it down into tiny pieces. It mixes food with digestive juices that contain enzymes to break down Proteins and Lipids. Acid (HCl) in the stomach kills bacteria, pH is typically 1.5-2. Food found in the stomach is called chyme.</p>

                     <h4>Small Intestine</h4>
                </div>
                <p>Small intestines are roughly 7 meters long. Lining of intestine walls has finger-like projections called villi, to increase surface area. The villi are covered in microvilli which further increases surface area for absorption. The surface area of the small intestines is roughly 250 m2. Nutrients from the food pass into the bloodstream through the small intestine walls. Small intestine secretes digestive enzymes.</p> 
                <p>Absorbs:</p>

                    <h4>Large Intestine</h4>
                </div>            
                <p>The large intestine has 3 main functions: absorbing water and electrolytes, producing and absorbing vitamins, and forming and moving stool to the rectum for elimination. More than 500 species of bacteria live in the large intestine, which mainly contribute to digestion. With the help of these bacteria in the large intestine, bacterial fermentation of indigestible materials takes place. The large intestine can contain 1-2 kg of bacteria that produce various types of vitamins, mainly vitamin K.</p>
