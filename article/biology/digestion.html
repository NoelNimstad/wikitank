                <p>The definition of digestion is “The biological process of breaking down food (a composition of macromolecules*)”; digestion is the process by which larger insoluble substances are broken down into small water-soluble substances that can be absorbed into the blood plasma.</p>
                <p class="note">* Macromolecules are molecules made up of smaller organic molecules. The four classes of macromolecules are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids.</p>
                <h2>What is the digestive system?</h2>
                <p>The digestive system is mainly made of your gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) but also consists of the liver, pancreas and gallbladder. The GI tract stretches across multiple different and hollow organs from mouth to anus, each with its respective functions.</p>
                <p>The hollow organs which make up the GI tract are:</p>
                <ul class="n lml">
                    <li>The mouth</li>
                    <li>Esophagus</li>
                    <li>Stomach</li>
                    <li>Small intestine</li>
                    <li>Large intestine</li>
                    <li>Anus</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The solid organs are, as previously mentioned, the liver, pancreas & gallbladder.</p>
                <p>Many of the follow organs themselves consist of different parts. The small intestine has three: the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. As for the large intestine, it consists of the appendix (vestigial structure), cecum (the first part), colon (the “main” part) and rectum.</p>
                <p>Other parts of your body that contribute to digestion include the bacteria in your GI tract (also referred to as “gut flora” or microbiome) and parts of your nervous & circulatory system. Working together, your nerves, hormones, bacteria, blood and digestive system organs digest the foods and liquids which you consume.</p>
