                    ;### Definition
                    ; Ventilation or gas exchange is the diffusion of gases from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, especially the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between an organism and its environment.
                    ; Gas exchange occurs in the lungs between alveolar air and the blood of the pulmonary capillaries.

                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Air enters the ventilation system through the nose or mouth and then passes down the trachea.
                        ;- The trachea has rings of cartilage in its walls to keep it open even when air pressure inside is low or pressure in surrounding tissues is high.
                        ;- The trachea divide to form two <b>bronchi</b> (one to each lung), also with walls strengthened with cartilage.
                        ;- Inside the lungs the bronchi divide repeatedly to form a tree-like structure of narrower airways, called <b>bronchioles</b>.
                        ;- At the end of narrowest bronchioles are groups of <b>alveoli</b>, where gas exchnage occurs.

                    ;### Lung Cancer
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Lung cancer is amongst the worlds most common cancers
                        ;- High mortality rate (only 15% of patients survive for more than 5 years post-diagnosis)
                            ;*
                                ;- 87% is caused by smoking, tobacco smoke contains alot of chemicals.
                                ;- 5% is caused by air pollution (diesel exhaust fumes, etc.)
                                ;- 3% is caused by passing smoking (other peoples smoke).
                                ;- Radon (a radioactive substance excreted from rocks in badly ventilated buildings) also causes lung cancer.
                                ;- Asbestos, silica can also cause lugn cancer when inhaled - often in construction sites.

                    ; Actually, how you can see, human healthy lugn is not very healthy (black dots on lugns). It's because of pollution in environment.

                    ;### Emphysema/Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Also caused by smoking.
                        ;- The thin-walled alveoli are replaced by air sacks with much thicker walls
                        ;- The total surface area for gas exchange is considerably reduced and the deistance over which diffusion of gases occur is increased, gas exchange is therefore much less effective.
                        ;- Lung become elastic, ventilation becomes more difficult. 
                        ;- Chronic disease because the damage to alveoli is usually irreversible.
                    ;**
                    ; All of this in turn causes low oxygen saturation in the blood, and there higher carbon dioxide concentrations.

                    ;### Breathing
                    ; When you breath out, you use the internal intercostal muscles (contracts), the diaphragm (relaxes) and your abdominal muscles (contracts). This decreases volume, which increases preassure, pushing out air.
                    ; When you breath in, you use the external intercostal muscles (contracts), the diaphragm (contracts) and your abdominal muscles (relaxes). This increases volume, letting more air flow in.
                    ;.[note] Gas flows between preassure differences, this is the principle that makes breathing work.
                    ; Your internal intercostal muscles are antagonistic; this means that when one flexes (contracts), the other relaxes.
