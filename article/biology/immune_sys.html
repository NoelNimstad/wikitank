                    ;### Defenition
                    ; The immune system is a complex network of organs, cells and proteins that defends the body against infection, whilst protecting the body's own cells. The immune system keeps a record of every germ (microbe) it has ever defeated so it can recognise and destroy the microbe quickly if it enters the body again.
                    
                    ---
                    ;### Structure
                    ;  This protection is called immunity. Humans have three types of immunity - innate, adaptive, and nonspecific: 
                    ;*[lml] 
                        ;- Nonspecific immunity: Nonspecific (or passive) immunity is "borrowed" from another source and it lasts for a short time. For example, antibodies in a mother's breast milk give a baby temporary immunity to diseases the mother has been exposed to.
                           Nonspecific External Barriers: skin, mucous membranes.<br>                         
                           ......................↓↓↓↓↓......................      
                        ;- Innate immunity: Everyone is born with innate (or natural) immunity, a type of general protection. For example, the skin acts as a barrier to block germs from entering the body. And the immune system recognizes when certain invaders are foreign and could be dangerous.
                           Innate Imune Response: phagocytic and natural killer cells, inflammation, fever. <br>
                           ......................↓↓↓↓↓......................     
                        ;- Adaptive immunity: Adaptive (or active) immunity develops throughout our lives. We develop adaptive immunity when we're exposed to diseases or when we're immunized against them with vaccines.
                           Adaptive Imune Response: cell-mediated immunity, humoral immunity.
                    ;**
                    Organs:
                    ;*[lml] 
                        ;- Primary lymphoid organs: the bone marrow and the thymus. They create special immune system cells called lymphocytes. 
                        ;- Secondary lymphoid organs:  the lymph nodes, the spleen, the tonsils and certain tissue in various mucous membrane layers in the body (for instance in the bowel).

                    ;### Inflamation
                    ;*[lml]
                        ;- Inflammation is signaled by mast cells, which release histamine.
                        ;- Histamine causes fluids to collect around an injury to dilute toxins. This causes swelling.
                        ;- The temperature of the tissues may rise, which can kill temperature-sensitive microbes.
                    ;**

                    ---
                    ;### Fever 
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Fever is a defense mechanism that can destroy many types of microbes.
                        
                        ;- While high fevers can be dangerous, some doctors recommend letting low fevers run their course without taking aspirin or ibuprofen.
                    ;** 

                    ---
                    ;### Specific defenses
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Specific defenses are those that give us immunity to certain diseases.
                        ;- In specific defenses, the immune system forms a chemical “memory” of the invading microbe. If the microbe is encountered again, the body reacts so quickly that few or no symptoms are felt.
                    ;**

                    ;### Major players
                    ; The major players in the immune system include:
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Macrophage - a type of white blood cell that surrounds and kills microorganisms, removes dead cells, and stimulates the action of other immune system cells.
                        ;- T cells (helper, cytotoxic, memory) - a type of white blood cell, direct fighters of foreign invaders and also produced cytokines, which are biological substances that help activate other parts of the immune system.
                        ;- B cells (plasma, memory) - a type of white blood cell that produce antibody molecules that can latch on and destroy invading viruses or bacteria.
                        ;- Antibody - a protein produced by the human immune system to tag and destroy invasive microbes.
                        ;- Antibiotic - various chemicals produced that is toxic to many bacteria. Some we use as medicins.
                        ;- Antigen:
                            ;*[lml]
                                ;- - Cells of the immune system are "trained" to recognize "self" proteins vs. "not self" proteins.
                                ;- - If an antigen ("not self") protein is encountered by a macrophage, it will bring the protein to a helper T-cell for identification.
                                ;- - If the helper T-cell recognizes the protein as a "not self", it wall launch an immune response.
                            ;**

                    ;### Helper T cells
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Helper T-cells have receptors for recognizing antigens. If they are presented with an antigen, they release cytokines to stimulate B-cell division.
                        ;- The helper T-cell is the key cell to signal an immune response. If helper T-cells are disabled, as they are in people with HIV, the immune system will not respond.
                    ;**

                    --- 
                    ;### B cells
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- B-cells in general produce antibodies. Those with antibodies that bind with the invader's antigen are stimulated to reproduce rapidly.
                        ;- B-cells differentiate into either plasma cells or memory B-cells. Plasma cells rapidly produce antibodies. Memory cells retain the "memory" of the invader and remain ready to divide rapidly if an invasion occurs.
                    ;**

                    ---
                    ;### Role of antibodies
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Antibodies released into the blood stream will bind to antigens that they are specific for.
                        ;- Antibodies may disable some microbes, or cause them to stick together. They "tag" microbes so that the microbes are quickly recognized by various white blood cells.
                    ;**

                    ---
                    ;### Calling a halt
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- When the invader is destroyed, the helper T-cell calls a halt to the immune response.
                        ;- Memory T-cells are formed, which can quickly divide and produce cytotoxic T-cells to quickly fight off the invader if it is ever encountered again.
                    ;**

                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Antibiotics help destroy bacteria (but not viruses).
                        ;- Antibiotics work in one of several ways:
                            ;*
                                ;- Slowing bacteria reproduction
                                ;- Interfering with bacteria cell wall formation.

                    ;### Antibiotic myths
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Antibiotics are not antibodies.
                        ;- Antibiotics do not weaken our immune system. They help it by weakening the bacteria.
                        ;- Humans do not become "immune" to antibiotics. Bacteria that resist antibiotics and are not completely destroyed may multiply, producing more antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

                    ;### Vaccine history
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Vaccination: (from vacca, Latin for cow) Invented by Edward Jenner in 1796. Jenner knew that dairy maids who had contracted cowpox never got smallpox. He inoculated a boy with secretions from cowpox sores, and showed the boy was immune to smallpox.
                    ;**

                    ;### How vaccines work
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Modern vaccines are created from killed bacteria or viruses, or fragments of proteins from these microbes.
                        ;- The proteins are recognized as antigens by our immune systems. This causes a mild immune response. Memory T-cells and B-cells remain ready to fight off the illness if it is encountered again.
                    ;**

                    ;### Vaccine myths
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- The flu vaccine does not give you the flu. Some people get the vaccine too late, or catch a cold and think they have the flu.
                        ;- Vaccines are not less effective than a "natural" infection with the illness. The immunity is the same, and a mild response to a vaccine is much less risky than a full blown response from a real virus.
                        ;- Vaccines do not cause autism.

                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Influenza is a respiratory virus. Strictly speaking, there is no stomach flu.
                        ;- There are, however, viruses that attack the digestive system. Noro viruses and rotavirus cause the nause, vomiting and diarrhea that many people call "stomach flu".
                        ;- Bacterial food poisoning can also cause fast-onset vomiting and diarrhea.

                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Allergies are an immune system reaction to harmless antigens.
                        ;- Some, such as pollen, may get in through the respiratory system. Fragments of food proteins may get through the digestive system.
                        ;- The next time these proteins are encountered, the immune system attacks them.
                        ;- Most of the symptoms are caused by histamines released by mast cells. That is why antihistamines are used to treat allergies.

                        ;- Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system fails to recognize a protein as "self" amd launches an attack.
                        ;- Multiple sclerosis, diabetes type 1 and rheumatoid arthritis are examples. None of these can be cured, but drugs can help slow the progress of these diseases.

                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Cancer occurs when the mechanisms that control cell division fail, and body cells divide out of control.
                        ;- Cytotoxic T-cells can recognize and destroy these cells. But if division is too rapid, the T-cells cannot keep up.
                        ;- Some cancer research involves assisting cytotoxic T-cells in recognizing and destroying cancer cells.

                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is caused by an infection by the HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), which attacks and destroys T-helper cells. Because it attacks the immune system directly, finding a vaccine has been difficult.
                        ;- Some drugs can slow down HIV reproduction, but no cure exists yet. Prevention is still the best "cure".
