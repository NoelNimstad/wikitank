                    ; Blood is the fluid that circulates in the heart, arteries, capillaries, and veins of a vertebrate animal carrying nourishment and oxygen to and bringing away waste products from all parts of the body.
                    ; Blood has four main components: plasma, red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), and platelets.
                    ; Hematocrit - red blood cell's as percent of total blood volume.

                    ;### Defenition
                    ; Erythrocytes, red blood cells (RBC), are the functional component of blood responsible for the transportation of gases and nutrients throughout the human body and for buffer blood pH. Erythrocytes are smaller than Leukocytes (WBC).
                    ;.[note] Do not confuse leukocyte with lymphocyte. The leukocytes are the white blood cells while the lymphocytes are a type of leukocyte. Thus, all lymphocytes are leukocytes but all leukocytes are not lymphocytes.

                        ;- The shape is flexible so that RBCs can pass through the smallest blood vessels, i.e. capillaries.
                        ;- No nucleus, no mitochondria.

                    ;### Hemoglobin
                    ; Hemoglobin is the protein that binds oxygen and carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin consists of: s{globin}.[t-red] and s{heme}.[t-red] pigment.
                    <div class="flex">

                    </div>
                    ; Each hemoglobin molecule has four globin chains (in hemoglobin A, the predominant form in adults, the hemoglobin molecule includes two alpha and two beta chains). Each globin chain is associated with one heme group, containing one atom of iron. Each of the four iron atoms can bind loosely with one molecule (two atoms) of oxygen. Thus, each hemoglobin molecule can transport eight oxygen atoms.
                    ; Carbon monoxide (CO) competes with oxygen for heme binding with a much higher affinity. Carbon monoxide is found in exhaust from cars.

                    ;### Production of Erythrocytes
                    ; All blood cells, including red and white, are produced in red bone marrow.
                    ; On average, one ounce, or 100 billion blood cells, are made each day.
                    ; Red bone marrow is primarily found in the medullary cavity of flat bones such as the sternum and pelvic bones (hip bones). This type of bone marrow contains hematopoietic stem cells, which are the stem cells that form blood cells.
