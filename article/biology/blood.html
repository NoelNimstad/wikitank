                    ;### Defenition
                    ; Erythrocytes, red blood cells (RBC), are the functional component of blood responsible for the transportation of gases and nutrients throughout the human body and for buffer blood pH. Erythrocytes are smaller than Leukocytes (WBC).
                    ;.[note] Do not confuse leukocyte with lymphocyte. The leukocytes are the white blood cells while the lymphocytes are a type of leukocyte. Thus, all lymphocytes are leukocytes but all leukocytes are not lymphocytes.

                    ; All blood cells, including red and white, are produced in red bone marrow.
                    ; On average, one ounce, or 100 billion blood cells, are made each day.
                    ; Red bone marrow is primarily found in the medullary cavity of flat bones such as the sternum and pelvic bones (hip bones). This type of bone marrow contains hematopoietic stem cells, which are the stem cells that form blood cells.

                    ; Each hemoglobin molecule has four globin chains (in hemoglobin A, the predominant form in adults, the hemoglobin molecule includes two alpha and two beta chains). Each globin chain is associated with one heme group, containing one atom of iron. Each of the four iron atoms can bind loosely with one molecule (two atoms) of oxygen. Thus, each hemoglobin molecule can transport eight oxygen atoms.
                    ; Carbon monoxide (CO) competes with oxygen for heme binding with a much higher affinity. Carbon monoxide is found in exhaust from cars.

                    ;*[lml]
                        ;- s{Anemia}.[t-red] - a condition in which the blood has an abnormally low oxygen-carrying capacity.
                        ;- s{Hemoglobinopathy}.[t-red] - a group of disorders in which there is abnormal production or structure of the hemoglobin molecule. It is passed down through families (inherited). This group of disorders includes hemoglobin C disease, hemoglobin S-C disease, sickle cell anemia, and thalassemias.
                        ;- s{Pyruvate kinase deficiency}.[t-red] - an inherited lack of the enzyme pyruvate kinase, which is used by red blood cells. Without this enzyme, red blood cells break down too easily, resulting in a low level of these cells (hemolytic anemia).
                        ;- s{Red cell membrane disorders}.[t-red] - inherited diseases due to mutations in various membrane or skeletal proteins, resulting in decreased red cell deformability, reduced life span and premature removal of the erythrocytes from the circulation.
                        ;- s{Hemolytic anemia}.[t-red] - a sub-type of anemia, a common blood disorder that occurs when the body has fewer red blood cells than normal. In hemolytic anemias, the low red blood cell count is caused by the destruction (or the underproduction) of RBC. It occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the bone marrow can make them.
                        ;- s{Nutritional anemia}.[t-red] - kind of anemia that can be directly attributed to nutritional disorders or deficiencies. Examples include Iron deficiency anemia and pernicious anemia.
                        ;- s{Porphyrias}.[t-red] - a group of disorders, meaning enzyme and/or substrate deficiency. Heme synthesis is a biochemical pathway which requires a number of steps, substrates, and enzymes. A deficiency in an enzyme or substrate leads to accumulation of intermediates of heme synthesis in blood, tissues, and urine.
                        ;- s{Polycythemia (or erythrocytosis)}.[t-red] - an increase in the absolute red blood cell (RBC) mass in the body. In practice, this is reflected by an increase in hemoglobin levels, or hematocrit, over what is considered physiologic for the particular age and gender. Polycythemia vera can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated. It can cause blood clots resulting in a heart attack, stroke, pulmonary embolism or liver and spleen enlargement.
                        ;- s{Hemochromatosis}.[t-red] - a condition in which the body takes up and stores more iron than it needs. The extra iron is stored in the liver, heart, and pancreas, which may cause liver disease, heart problems, organ failure, and cancer.

                    ; They have a multi-lobed nucleus, which consists of three to five lobes connected by slender strands. This gives the neutrophils the appearance of having multiple nuclei, hence the name polymorphonuclear leukocyte. The cytoplasm may look transparent because of fine granules that are pale lilac when stained.

                        Reason: The descendants of a single stem cell in red bone marrow tend to remain unspecialized and mitotic, and suppress or impair normal bone marrow function.                     
                        ;- s{Proliferative disorders}.[t-red] - an increase in the number of white blood cells. This increase is commonly a reaction due to infection, but may, less commonly, be related to some types of cancer.
                        ;- s{Leukopenias}.[t-red] - a decrease in the number of white blood cells, which can be caused by cells being destroyed by an illness or by other conditions.
