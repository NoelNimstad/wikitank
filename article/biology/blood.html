                    ; Erythrocytes, red blood cells (RBC), are the functional component of blood responsible for the transportation of gases and nutrients throughout the human body and for buffer blood pH. Erythrocytes are smaller than Leukocytes (WBC).
                    ;.[note] Do not confuse leukocyte with lymphocyte. The leukocytes are the white blood cells while the lymphocytes are a type of leukocyte. Thus, all lymphocytes are leukocytes but all leukocytes are not lymphocytes.

                    ; Red bone marrow is primarily found in the medullary cavity of flat bones such as the sternum and pelvic bones (hip bones). This type of bone marrow contains hematopoietic stem cells, which are the stem cells that form blood cells.

Each globin chain is associated with one heme group, containing one atom of iron. Each of the four iron atoms can bind loosely with one molecule (two atoms) of oxygen. Thus, each hemoglobin molecule can transport eight oxygen atoms.
                    ; Carbon monoxide (CO) competes with oxygen for heme binding with a much higher affinity. Carbon monoxide is found in exhaust from cars.

                        ;- s{Hemoglobinopathy}.[t-red] - a group of disorders in which there is abnormal production or structure of the hemoglobin molecule. It is passed down through families (inherited). This group of disorders includes hemoglobin C disease, hemoglobin S-C disease, sickle cell anemia, and thalassemias.
                        ;- s{Pyruvate kinase deficiency}.[t-red] - an inherited lack of the enzyme pyruvate kinase, which is used by red blood cells. Without this enzyme, red blood cells break down too easily, resulting in a low level of these cells (hemolytic anemia).
                        ;- s{Red cell membrane disorders}.[t-red] - inherited diseases due to mutations in various membrane or skeletal proteins, resulting in decreased red cell deformability, reduced life span and premature removal of the erythrocytes from the circulation.
                        ;- s{Hemolytic anemia}.[t-red] - a sub-type of anemia, a common blood disorder that occurs when the body has fewer red blood cells than normal. In hemolytic anemias, the low red blood cell count is caused by the destruction (or the underproduction) of RBC. It occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the bone marrow can make them.
                        ;- s{Nutritional anemia}.[t-red] - kind of anemia that can be directly attributed to nutritional disorders or deficiencies. Examples include Iron deficiency anemia and pernicious anemia.
                        ;- s{Porphyrias}.[t-red] - a group of disorders, meaning enzyme and/or substrate deficiency. Heme synthesis is a biochemical pathway which requires a number of steps, substrates, and enzymes. A deficiency in an enzyme or substrate leads to accumulation of intermediates of heme synthesis in blood, tissues, and urine.
                        ;- s{Polycythemia (or erythrocytosis)}.[t-red] - an increase in the absolute red blood cell (RBC) mass in the body. In practice, this is reflected by an increase in hemoglobin levels, or hematocrit, over what is considered physiologic for the particular age and gender. Polycythemia vera can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated. It can cause blood clots resulting in a heart attack, stroke, pulmonary embolism or liver and spleen enlargement.
                        ;- s{Hemochromatosis}.[t-red] - a condition in which the body takes up and stores more iron than it needs. The extra iron is stored in the liver, heart, and pancreas, which may cause liver disease, heart problems, organ failure, and cancer.
